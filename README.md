# fibonacci
1. Write a Java library that implements a Fibonacci calculator. 
2. Make sure that you have unit tests that are covering the edge cases.
3. Create a Web application that hosts the functionality of the library with
    * Java back-end
    * JavaScript (React or Angular)  front-end
4. The service must have user authentication against an arbitrary type user database.
5. Make it possible to somehow control the biggest number a certain user can call the service on. 
   Display a meaningful error message if the user entered a bigger number than the allowed.
6. Make sure we can run your application easily and quickly. For example 
    * using Docker, ./gradlew bootRun, ...
    * or deploy it to a publicly available site
